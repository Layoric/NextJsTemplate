title: Example Post
description: This frontmatter description will appear below the title

This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

<TestComponent name="next-mdx-remote" />

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

<HelloApi name="world" />

The above dynamic component calls the your ServiceStack API.
